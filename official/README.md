# TensorFlow Official Models

The TensorFlow official models are a collection of example models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable TensorFlow API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read.

Below is the list of models contained in the garden:

[mnist](mnist): A basic model to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.

[resnet](resnet): A deep residual network that can be used to classify both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet's dataset of 1000 classes.

More models to come!
